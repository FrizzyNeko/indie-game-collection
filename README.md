# Indie Game Collection

Welcome to my **Indie Game Collection**! This repository showcases my small-scale game projects. Each project represents my journey in game development, from concept to playable demo.

## Current Project

- **Platform:** Web / Windows  
- **Engine:** GameMaker Studio 2  
- **Description:** Your ex is mocking you from the streetâ€¦ so what do you do? Grab whatever you can find and start hurling it from the balcony! 
- **Play it on Itch.io:** [Link](https://amorygamestudio.itch.io/crush-on-you)

## About This Repository
This repo contains references to my released games and may include:
- Game demos playable via Itch.io
- Source files for learning purposes (if included)
- Documentation of mechanics and design decisions

I create these games as a playground to improve my skills in gameplay design, storytelling, and pixel art. More projects coming soon!
